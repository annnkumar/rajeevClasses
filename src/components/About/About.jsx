          <span>About our Director</span>
          <span className="a-founder">
          I am Rajeev Kumar, the founder of Vidyarthi Coaching. I completed my education from Class 1 to 12 under the Bihar Board. Starting this coaching institute has been an inspiring journey filled with challenges, but I never gave up. With strong determination, continuous motivation, and the unwavering support of my parents and brother, I kept moving forward. Every step was a learning experience, and my belief in God gave me strength during tough times. Today, Vidyarthi Coaching stands as a symbol of dedication and the dream to make quality education accessible to every student.
